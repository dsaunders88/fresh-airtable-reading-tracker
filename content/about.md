Welcome to my personal library! This is my (ambitious, flawed, but gratifying) work-in-progress to build my ideal reading tracker app using Airtable and Deno Fresh.

All of the book data is stored in an Airtable backend and is rendered on the server, on-demand, on this website. HTMX progressively enhances Fresh's zero client-side JavaScript with dynamic fetching (requiring no page reloads) and snappy navigation.

You can read more about my process of building this project here:
